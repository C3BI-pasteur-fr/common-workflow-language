Common Workflow Language
========================

This repo holds in-development draft description of the specification being developed on the
[Common Workflow Language mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-workflow-language).

CWL is an informal task force consisting of people from various organizations
that have an interest in portability of bioinformatics workflows.  The goal is
to specify a way to describe bioinformatics tools and workflows that is
powerful, easy to use and allows for portability of tools/workflows and
reproducibility of runs.

Please be aware that Common Workflow Language is still under heavy development
and that the following draft specification documents are likely to contain
errors or be out of date.  Current status is best reflected by the
[reference implementation](reference/), [conformance test suite](conformance/) and
[examples](examples/).
